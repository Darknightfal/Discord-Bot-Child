Right wouldn't usually do this but we need 1 person for a premier team on valorant
Sadly there are a few requirements (acceptions can be made ofc)

Requirements:
- Must be Based in the EU
- Is able to be free most Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays between the times of (6:30pm-9:30pm GMT/Britain time) (family matters/irl plans take priorities so we will not mind, just let us know that you are not able to play)
- Is able to listen to the teams IGL 
- not complain about what role/agent they play (its so we are able to experiment on who would work best in each role)
- Must be serious towards winning
