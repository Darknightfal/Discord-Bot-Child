[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> tyler is still sleeping cause some dumbass kept him awake playing phas
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> this is how ik
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> ayyy, i'll spam each and every chat now to reach level 500 and then check the level logs
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> XD
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> geez xD
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> wtf brpo
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> 11 hours
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> its a 60 second cooldown
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> nah i think thats when they go off, it was probably only for a few hours
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> how dhes the rest work, does it count like every letter in the message or just a message sent?
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> once a user sends a message
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> theyre put onto a cooldown and it wont give any xp until the cooldown is finished
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> though ive thought about changing that cooldown since 60 seconds seems too long for me ;-;
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> ok so its not like "every words = 1 exp" its just "mesage = 10 exp = set cooldown 60 sec"
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> even if the message is 1 letter
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> no
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> its just ives a random amount between 5 and 20
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> well yeah i was just making an example bro 😭
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> ik ik
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> i was just alittle confused
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> at first
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> thats the xp part of the code
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> i see i see
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> so it just counts what ever message gets sent by the user, not counting how long it is or anything
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> yeah
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> now i'mma gamble and guess how much exp i get every message
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> XD
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> example "i bet this is 8 exp"
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> "i bet this is 12exp"
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> thank you dark, my new addiction is here

[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> huh
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> iwoke up at 6am
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> thing is, your body actually don't count it as sleeping if you keep waking up, so lets say you do workouts or you have internal bleeding and etc, when you sleep, your body pretty much shuts down and only the necessary things are still running, this allows your body to then fix all the damages on your body, so me that works out, i need sleep so my body can heal the muscles so i actually gain from my workouts and don't just slowly destroy myself, and for that i need long one go sleeps, taking naps does not count as sleeping
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> the more you know
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> .\
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> i read all of tha
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> and it hurt my head
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> civic code me an ai please
[«💭»・general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> sleep fix body, sleep means long sleeps in one go, short sleeps is naps, naps don't count as sleep

Things that everyone need to work on is

- Playing too agressive

[general] box_r ==> 👍
[«🎥»・media] epictk25 ==> kinda want a tie fighter tho
[«🎥»・media] epictk25 ==> so i can sneak in to the death star
[general] distortlight ==> <@482204588666126339> do you wanna switch over to a sub position for playing, you wouldn’t need to hop on every week then, it’ll be more chill plus you’re not too competitive when it comes to it, up to you tho would be all good with whatever you decide
[general] box_r ==> sure yeah Ill do that
[general] box_r ==> 👍
[general] distortlight ==> Alright np
[general] distortlight ==> The roles are gonna stay how they are for us, the only difference is I’ll be bringing someone in to be a second support for IGL as I get lost in what to do sometimes
[general] distortlight ==> <@561932232437268481> if Magnus doesn’t hop on I’ll need you to fill in
[general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> thats alright i got nothing else going on
[general] distortlight ==> Alr
[general] distortlight ==> Thanks
[general] distortlight ==> Since this is practice we’ll be running an unconventional team
- Jett
- Reyna
- Breach
- Cypher
- Omen
[general] distortlight ==> Usually I wouldn’t prefer double duelist for a premier match but I wanna explore the entry capabilities of a 2 site split with them or possibility one lurking and getting an entry from another area
[general] magnustwo ==> <@869406935357743205> when again?
[general] distortlight ==> 8pm
[general] magnustwo ==> your time?
[general] distortlight ==> yes
[general] distortlight ==> its only practice
[general] distortlight ==> but if you cant play shadow can
[general] distortlight ==> an hour from now
[general] magnustwo ==> I can but dont need to if he would like to play
[general] distortlight ==> its up to you
[general] magnustwo ==> I dont mind
[general] magnustwo ==> <@561932232437268481>
[general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> yesh?
[general] magnustwo ==> would you  like to play?

[general] epictk25 ==> can i for an explanation about the team for pearl?
[general] distortlight ==> what?
[general] epictk25 ==> like i wanna know your thinking for the team comp
[general] epictk25 ==> cause i was thinking double smoke would be better
[general] epictk25 ==> having viper and omen
[general] distortlight ==> someone doesnt real
[general] distortlight ==> no
[general] distortlight ==> single smoke
[general] distortlight ==> double ini
[general] distortlight ==> viper would be a fine pick for comp but it gives too much site space for the enemies on B
[general] distortlight ==> A viper is useless
[general] epictk25 ==> oh casue they can push up link easier?
[general] distortlight ==> they can hold the entire site from the side were not pushing
[general] distortlight ==> they can push out B link giving them many angles to hold
[general] distortlight ==> wed be pushing into them if we want to take site control
[general] distortlight ==> so well be killing ourselves in the process
[general] epictk25 ==> okay
[general] nightmarxz ==> honestly having me on tejo is a liability to the team
[general] nightmarxz ==> i cannot play tejo to save my life
[general] distortlight ==> Not trying to be rude but having you on anything other than seni is a liability
[«💭»・general] hetmastertje ==> <@869406935357743205> <@561932232437268481> u wanna play a free survival game?

[info] distortlight ==> <@&1335327138424815616> 
It looks like were going to have to abolish the premier team 

Good job to everyone achieving 525 total score this act with a 5-1 win/loss rate
If things get sorted within 2 weeks then we might be able to continue but this is a highly doubtful outcome

Good luck with comp/playing in general
[general] box_r ==> Rip
[general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> What? Why?
[general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> Are we not able to qualify or whats going on?
[general] jay_ssssun ==> We could if we can get 5
[general] distortlight ==> Tyler left and unfriended me plus I was losing more and more motivation to play with him that’s why I started saying that you guys should play without me
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> <@768932463007236116> they’re apparently making more food types for rust
[general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> We were so close too man
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> And food apparently will start spoiling now aswell with that updated •-•
[general] distortlight ==> I know
[general] distortlight ==> If we end up being able to have 5 somehow it’s fine we can continue
[general] distortlight ==> But at the rate it’s currently looking it’s impossible
[general] rsw_shadow251004 ==> Actually kinda sad
[general] distortlight ==> You’re more than welcome to play the games with tyler but note that I won’t be participating if he is in these games
[general] distortlight ==> Since I think he’s still in the team

[general] distortlight ==> <@&1335327138424815616> Prem could still happen if Magnus, Night, Shadow, Jay and i are all free for those games. then aswell you are able to also q with tyler and boxer if need be but the issue with jay being able to play will come up meaning a player down. one issue
[general] jay_ssssun ==> I’ll just have to ask Tyler for his account details
[general] jay_ssssun ==> And turns out the painting is moved from this week to next week Thursday and Wednesday
[general] jay_ssssun ==> But if we need to play boxer then hopefully I could get on Tyler’s account
[general] jay_ssssun ==> Or magnus’s if he would be willing

[«🤖»・bot-commands] distortlight ==> ive been pm for around 2 months now ;-;
[«🤖»・bot-commands] distortlight ==> you cant call me a sweat when ive only gone up like 10 levels in that time
[general] box_r ==> Wait how does the prem work, are we only allowed to use the accounts that the team was set up with?
[general] distortlight ==> so we can invite an account but the only accounts that qualify to join are iron/bronze peak accounts
[general] distortlight ==> silver might work but i doubt it
[general] distortlight ==> theres even a chance that bronze couldnt play
[general] box_r ==> Ah
[general] box_r ==> I was gonna say I have an account thats like level 14
[general] box_r ==> or smth
[general] distortlight ==> since its trying to keep our teams skill range to our premier division
[general] distortlight ==> so basically if any rank could join at any time you could create a team as a full iron
[general] distortlight ==> play a game
[general] distortlight ==> lock your team in that division and then have a full 5 stack of radiants against other iron teams
[general] box_r ==> fair enough
[general] distortlight ==> its gotta be comp ready sadly

[general] distortlight ==> alrighth
[general] distortlight ==> <@&1335327138424815616> Serious Question, Are we going to be playing as a team again next act? excluding Tyler
[general] distortlight ==> if so i got a few things to say
[general] magnustwo ==> im down
[general] distortlight ==> we need atleast 5
[general] distortlight ==> <@1026441153891012618> <@711208977677025311>
[general] distortlight ==> what do you guys want
[general] nightmarxz ==> Yes ofc
[general] jay_ssssun ==> Yeah I’m down
[general] distortlight ==> alright
[general] distortlight ==> so then

Next act we will most likely have to recreate the team in order for us to all be able to play on our mains as the team has been locked to our peak ranks and we are unable to invite people who are peaked above all our ranks, 
Should we keep the name as Red Rebellion (#Rebel) or Make a new one with something like Team Nova (#TN)  

Now onto the few main things
If we ever have anything against another member or each other we are to put it aside for premier  
We need to majorly work on our team work and team play
Crosshair placement needs to be fixed for some people 
We also need to play more passive on most occasions as we just give up numbers to the enemies
Finally when it comes to what role we will be on this is how it will go

- Magnus - duelist
- Jay - Initiator/Sentinel
- Dark - Sentinel/Controller
- Shadow - Controller
- Nightmare - Sentinel
- Sub Players - Fills the role that theyre subbing in for

This will be everyones assigned Roles hoping all is fine with this

[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> 🙏

[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> A few hours before our games
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> i think the maps are randomly selected once we go into a bracket
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> or they could also be randomly picked when we load in like comp
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> Yeah that would make me end my life
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> They should keep the system they had back in the days where you could map vito
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> it could also be that
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> im unsure how playoffs is going to work so we will find out
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> We played ascent for every game of our playoffs because we just kept picking it 😭😭
[«💭»・general] distortlight ==> i doubt its like that then

[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> that really arent optional
[general] distortlight ==> <@&1335327138424815616> Ill be at my nans for the 2nd and 4th practice games though i should still be able to hop on but wont perform the same as ill be on a 60hz monitor and on a setup im not used too
[general] distortlight ==> also jay did you ever find out about scrims this weekend?
[general] jay_ssssun ==> most teams denied im waiting for a response from a few lower ranked teams at the moment
[general] distortlight ==> alr
[general] jay_ssssun ==> its a rank problem ngl 😭
[general] distortlight ==> not our fault
[general] distortlight ==> cant help people being hardstuck in the rank they ar
[general] jay_ssssun ==> yeah im tryna get them to think like that but oh well egotistical pricks will be egotistical pricks
[general] distortlight ==> Shadow should be gold, night honestly needs to stay in silver until they stop panicking and fixes their aim from insta crouch spray magnus is low gold since he has the aim and stuff just not the game sense
[general] jay_ssssun ==> its mostly just the teams with coaches and the coaches are being bitchy
[general] jay_ssssun ==> like stfu u aint kaplin bro
[general] distortlight ==> wild times
[general] jay_ssssun ==> your players can play against lower ranks and still improve
[general] distortlight ==> not always tho
[general] jay_ssssun ==> just need to think of it like a t1 team scrimming a t2 team
[general] jay_ssssun ==> still get practice from it
[general] distortlight ==> thats true
[general] distortlight ==> but still the ranks are low for everyone rn
[general] jay_ssssun ==> yeaaah
[general] distortlight ==> magnus is down in bronze from g3
[general] jay_ssssun ==> ranked has actually gone well today for me
[general] jay_ssssun ==> probably gonna get diamond back at some point soon
[general] distortlight ==> i played one game as an initiator and decided im never touching initiator again
[general] distortlight ==> even though we won
[general] jay_ssssun ==> waylay is my goat
[general] distortlight ==> damn
[general] distortlight ==> should just stop q with night and solo q for awhile
[general] distortlight ==> you have alts for reason and night being boosted wont help you into dia again
[general] distortlight ==> and regardless i will always give the hard truth to what rank i think someone should be
[general] jay_ssssun ==> i need to start warming up
[general] jay_ssssun ==> first 2 games were before a dm and last 3 were after a dm
[general] distortlight ==> L
[general] distortlight ==> also
[general] distortlight ==> during next act
[general] distortlight ==> youll need to play some of the games with boxer instead of me
[general] jay_ssssun ==> why so but okay okay
[general] distortlight ==> ill be at my grandads
[general] distortlight ==> i dislike his pc setup as he uses a 60 inch monitor for gaming and i will not be able to play on that
[general] jay_ssssun ==> 60 inch for gaming is wild
[general] distortlight ==> he may have a 2 grand pc but not worth hurting my head
[general] distortlight ==> he only plays world of tanks tho tbh
[general] jay_ssssun ==> bro got that dragon dildo pc set up
[general] jay_ssssun ==> ah that makes sense
[general] jay_ssssun ==> world of tanks on a 60 inch monitor would go hard
[general] distortlight ==> its the worst tho
[general] distortlight ==> unless hes changed his setup but thats a doubt
[general] jay_ssssun ==> yeaah
[general] jay_ssssun ==> i think we bin off the icebox games
[general] distortlight ==> i cant play the new duelist cause i overcook with it
[general] distortlight ==> i still frag and stuff but i just over cook
[general] jay_ssssun ==> the only thing i dont like about her is how
[general] jay_ssssun ==> her mollie insta throws
[general] jay_ssssun ==> you dont get to hold it
[general] distortlight ==> i like it
[general] jay_ssssun ==> i was tryna clutch and mollied myself on my first game because i didnt know it was instacast but at least i won the round still 😭
[general] distortlight ==> thats why you go into the range to test abilities first
[general] jay_ssssun ==> yeaahh
[general] jay_ssssun ==> prolly shoulda done that but comp more fun
[general] jay_ssssun ==> only enjoyable mode
[general] distortlight ==> nah
[general] distortlight ==> swifty is enjoyable if youre playing to have fun sometimes
[general] jay_ssssun ==> idk its not rewarding enough for me
[general] distortlight ==> makes sense but it still fun considering you can meet people whos just trying to have fun
[general] jay_ssssun ==> true true
[general] jay_ssssun ==> no one talks in plat elo bro
[general] jay_ssssun ==> im tryna conversate
[general] jay_ssssun ==> 😭 me and shadow might be banned from playing with each other

[general] jay_ssssun ==> i have a higher rate with jai
[general] distortlight ==> thats probably cause of 5 stack
[general] jay_ssssun ==> prolly
[general] jay_ssssun ==> wonderful stats
[general] distortlight ==> solo and fives are my best apprently
[general] distortlight ==> also looks like you can only solo q
[general] distortlight ==> if you want a good wr
[general] jay_ssssun ==> my main just cursed
[general] jay_ssssun ==> we are cursed 💀
[general] distortlight ==> youre just cursed to q with people
[general] distortlight ==> should just become a solo q demon
[general] jay_ssssun ==> my alt is uncursed

[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> no reason we had to redecoratemy room... some of the other rooms got done and apparently its not alright for my room to be a mismatching shade of egg white than the rest 💀
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and now ive gotta deal with being a fkin ice cube every day
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1256417483867291740/1325284251968737392/26325A04-5C31-4F9E-B8BD-4AD5740B7A67.gif
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> what rank are u
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> unranked rn
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> alr ima buy a na account what rank do i buy then
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> ...
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> you low
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> i just cba to grind 20 levels
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> also how does the game actually choose ur rank? <@869406935357743205> bc when it matchmakes its giving me mostly mid diamonds, which suggests it thinks im around that. but then after the match (in which i drop 31 against said diamonds) it says "ur plat 2"
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i dont get it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if it thinks im diamond ish level
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> whys it placing me mid plat
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and if it thinks im mid plat
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> fair
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> whys it putting me against mid diamonds
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> i was silver last time i was ranked
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> either way theres a contradiction
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> it should give you more rank rating until its the rank it thinks you are
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> then itll slow down
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> huh
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so it places u below where it thinks u actually are? and gives u a boost until u get to where it thinks u r??
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yes
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> tf is the point. why not just accurately place me...
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> just in case it gets your rank wrong
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> breh
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> so you should just gain more RR and less for a loss
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so strange
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> agreed
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if it just placed me accurately
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> or what it thought is accurate
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and it turned out im actually better or worse
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> by playing games
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> my rank would naturally adjust
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> down or up
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yeah pretty much
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so its completely pointless
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> sounds more like
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> just wait till you see what rank reset is XD
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> theyre trying to just force people to play more matches than they would normally to get back to the rank they were each time it resets
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> yeh
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i assume rank reset is just kinda the same as me doing my first 5 placements
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> everyone does 5
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yeah but places you lower than you was the act before
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> regardless of how well you perform
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> got my account ordered
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> yeh kinda like how it placed me lower than where it thinks i am
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> 😭
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> same system to determine rank id assume
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so it puts u lower and speeds u up until u r back where u deserve to be
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yep
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> exactly
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> hella dumb. definitely just a trick to force people to play a bunch every time
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so u cant just be satisfied and stay whgere u r
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and not play
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> i mean every act people who get 1300 score in radiant go all the way down to immo 1 i think
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> oh god
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> i just know they have to get all that score from scratch again
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> we losign this game
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ouch
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> i never play smokes
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> real
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> and have never played smokes on this map
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> its so u cant just do ur 5 placements, get back the rank u had before
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and stop
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> 😭
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yeah
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> u have to do ur placements, then play however many games of the sped up rr gain
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> but rank reset only happens every 3 acts
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> scummy but effective
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> how long is an act
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> around 50-70 days
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so only twice a year
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> thats not sooo bad
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> just depends on how long they wanna make it
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yeah
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> at the start of a new act tahts isnt rank reset there will be a placement game
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> <@768932463007236116> what did the kid do wrong bro
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> itll just continue you from where you left off since thats only for immo+ players
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oh
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> weird
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> XD
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> just didnt wanna hear a child
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ig they wanna target immo players just sitting at the top not playing to avoid people getting boosted up there
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and then just stopping playing ranked
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> but collecting the rewards
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> for being immo
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> you still get the ranked reward even if you drop down to play
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> you just have to make it to that elo
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i meant
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> they get boosted once
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and then for forever
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> can claim the immo rewards
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> ahh makes sense
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> or at least until actual 6 month reset
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> thats prolly why only immo gets reset more often
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> you only get a gun buddy every 6 months for the ranked rewards
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> ;-;
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oh
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> then i have no idea
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> yeah...
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> yeah the rank rewards are doggyu
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> people usually get themselves boosted to say "i made it to this elo so im better than you"
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> do u get valorant points at all if youre in the top 500 etc?
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> nah
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> just a buddy
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> is there anything like overwatchs gold guns?
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> nope
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> 💀
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> literally nothing like that
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> this is the ranked rewards
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> just a buddy...
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> no special cards
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> buddys r dogshit
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> nothing
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i find buddys distracting af
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so i wouldnt even use it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if i got a top 500 one
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> they jangle around
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> while im moving
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and shooting
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> tbh tho the radiant one looks nice
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> only semi cool thing is if you get in immo top 15k it will say the number you were when the act ended on your rank triangle
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> yeh but they flap about
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and distract me
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> idk what a rank triangle is but sounds cool
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> this is what it looks like up until immo
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i think the highest my friend has been was top 1k she said
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> she trynna get top 500
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> then immo 3
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> she made it
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> ill go play a game rn to show you
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> shes the one that got me to start playing
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> but she barely plays. only really goes on to play ranked from time to time
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> otherwise shes always on sea of thieves loool
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> this is the number 1 rad in EU
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> yeah if she wants top 500 she needs to just spam ranked
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> thats what it looks like also
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ye shes kinda given up. apparently her character got nerfed last year and her motivation has been in the bin since
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> thats his/her games aswell
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> i wasnt cool enough for a number
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> nice!
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i mean not nice about not getting a number
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> who did she play?
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> but nice about immortal!
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> sky
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> eh
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> skye is still viable
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> apparently they made it so the flash doesnt recharge
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and u also cant cancel the flash
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> idk
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i havent got the character but thats what she told me
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> yeah no more fake flash
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> and only 2 flashes a round
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> fake flash sounds so funny
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> its weird that some agents have rehcargeable abilities
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and some dont
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> you used to be able to pop the flash and then just throw it at them but not activate it so they would turn 😭
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> surely they couldve nerfed sky in other ways to keep the continuity of all agents having abilities that recharge
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> LMAOOOO
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> thats like the fkin simple move
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> this guy is on his way to radiant rn
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> why did they remove fake flashing? it sounds like it was a cool niche tech that provided higher levels of skill expression
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i doubt it was op lol
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> it got abused a lot
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> since youre just swinging dry at that point
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if you try it vs multiple people even if the time window advantage the fake flash gives
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> lets u get 1
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ur gonna die to a 2nd guy
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> so you see how the guy on enemy team has numbers
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> idk. its just a shame when devs reduce the skill ceiling in games
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> yeah idk why they removed it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ive seen it all the time in other games where they nerf characters in ways that doesnt affect most people that play the character really, but just affects the very best players
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so that it just makes the games ceiling come down
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> its cool seeing people absolutely master characters and push the character
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> which one are you
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> i have my triangle off
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> but cypher top left
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> why does everyone run viper on that map? i had a viper in the game i played on it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> but i think astra works super well for the map
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oneof the better astra maps for me
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> viper has good lineups on the map
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> wdym
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> as in their smokes line up well with the map layout/
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ?
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> the line wall smoke thingy
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> my viper kept missing her wall on icebox
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> Yeah that and her mollies for post plant
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> she kept not smoking off the raised platform bit on b
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> her wall would just go on the ground in front of it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so they could see over
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i kept having to smoke off the raised bit
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ._.
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> viper doesnt seem all that good. her ult is a big smoke kinda but it blocks your own vision too
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and you have to stay in it
[«🎥»・media] nightmarxz ==> Viper is good
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so the enemies can spray u or ambush u just as much as u can them
[«🎥»・media] nightmarxz ==> No not really
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and the size of her ult smoke can be a bad thing because it gives them so many different spots they can enter the smoke so u cant see all the spots they can go into it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so they can walk silently in and backstab u rly easily
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> unlike a normal astra smoke say where if im inside it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i can see the majority of the ways they can walk into it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> <@869406935357743205> let me know when u r warmed pu
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> up*
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> shi im in a game 😭
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oh lmao
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> np
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ending soon?
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if so ill wait
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if not i might q one
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ah youre 0-0 aha
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> its a bug
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> aight ill go play one in a sec. hopefully will finish same time as u
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oh
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> how many rounds in r u
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> just 2
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> now it doesnt even show u online for me
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> wtf
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> i just dc
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oh
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> lol
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> aight ill q one and should finish roughly same time as ur game then
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> <@345297300878262272> only problem with higher elo is they argue for no reason at all
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> 0-7
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> were gonna lose
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> dark i have a viper flaming a sova for trying to post plant with his ult and they have been arguing for like 5 straight rounds no stoppage
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> 😭
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> L
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> ez game fr XD
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> im actually in love with this game
[«💭»・general] civiccupid ==> listenitng to a 9 year old curse himself out is funny
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Rip. I ended up making dinner instead of playing a match
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> I'll just wait for ur game to ebd
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> End
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> its finished
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> How do I turn on the extra stats u have
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> gotta do something irl rn
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Wtf
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> That was fast af
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> i use an external software called valorant tracker
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Np. Should I queue one?
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> that you install through an ap
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> i wont be long
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Its not bannable? It looks like it gives extra info from rounds
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Oki
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> nah not banable
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> https://www.overwolf.com/
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> anything made by overwolf is allowed in val
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Overwolf aimbot when
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> even an ai app they made that can tell you how long till spike blows up
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Tf
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> That sounds hella like cheating
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> i used to use it
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> it can remind you your crosshair placement is too low
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> it can igl mid round for you
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> its crazy
[«💭»・general] jay_ssssun ==> 😭
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Like I'm sure if someone developed a mod that detects the audio of enemy abilities and tells you when they're back off cooldown
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> That would be considered cheating
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> But its the same shi as what they're allowing
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> that one sounds like a competitive advantage which means it is cheating
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Yeh exactly
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> its allowed by riot
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> 😭
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Wild
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> im ready to play
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> And yet they'd prolly ban u for using the mod I described that tells u when ur enemies abilities r off cooldown
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Based on timers started off audio
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> they partnered with overwolf and have stated that anything overwolf is allowed to be used in val which is wild
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> "It's cheating... Unless it's made by the guys that give us money"
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> "Then go ahead"
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> 😭 type shit
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Aight heading to my room
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Or a mod that detects the audio of enemy abilities
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> lit
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> And displays to you which abilities the enemy team have renaining
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Remaining*
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Its the exact same idea as detecting spike plant audio and starting a timer
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> But a mod that tells u what abilities the enemies have left
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Would be superrrr bannable
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> anything that gives you a competitive advantage over you just knowing timing shhould be considered cheating
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Yeh, because me not having to count in my head
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> Is absolutely giant
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> exactly
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> For my ability to focus on my fights
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> it was a very big advantage when i used it
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> idk why i stopped tbh
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> these are just a few of the alerts it can give you
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> and then you can get custom ones as well
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> this one is wild
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> competitive advantage
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> yeah idk how they allow this
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> getting told the exact hp an enemy has left is insane
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> how tf would it know this
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> sounds
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> thats not even info u get urself
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> no but
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> wallbangs
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> sounds and it can track everything in the game
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> that just sounds invasive on valorant
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> its impossible to know exactly how much u hit someone for if u hit a few shots through the corner of a wall etc
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> yeh
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> and the anti cheat usually doesnt like that type of stuff
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i didnt mean how does it know this in a technical sense
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i meant
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> without additional info the playere doesnt normally get
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> how could it know
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> because i dont think theres a way
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> to know exactly how much ur wallbangs did
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> its a crazy thing for riot to allow ngl
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> without game data from the api or whatever
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> 100%
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> id love to be able to see that my headshot dink only did 56 or whatever
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> instead of thinking i did 110 etc
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> and then the other thing is
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> you can talk to it mid round and ask questions and it talks back
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> 😭
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> see while all these r definitely unfair advantages, u CAN actually time this stuff urself
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> but the dmg dealt shit
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> is unreal
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> bc thats ACTUALLY impossible
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> to do
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> without mods
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> real
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> yeahhh they should prolly look into it a lil more and change their minds 😭
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> this one just calling you doggy at that point
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> IM CRYING
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> I GOT CARRIED SO HARD
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> 💀
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> washed ass mf
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> bad day for me
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> but when i went to peek a corner the enemies were all dead
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> thats fair
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> atp i give up
[«🎥»・media] jay_ssssun ==> idk what i did different back then
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> i am washed lit
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> these are all my games today
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> and only did well on jett 😭
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> <@345297300878262272> my pc dying 1 min
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> <@869406935357743205> did u l;oad
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> ok bc we loaded
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> just now
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> restarting game
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> <@711208977677025311> only took this many
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> stole all of our phoenix kills
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i only had a FEWWW stinkers
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> the 4k on lotus tho
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> they threw so hard
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> real
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> they threw so many rounds
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i think the round that broke their mental and their round streak
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> was the round
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i jumped the trip on b
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and killed 3
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> most likely
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> that was a W play fr
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> they must have been MADDDD at their cypher
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> for fkin up the trip height
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> probably though it is a common problem
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> how come
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> it seems fairly simple
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> to place it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> especially if youre a cypher player
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> the easiest way is to crouch and place it at head level but alot of people are too lazy
[«🎥»・media] distortlight ==> so thats why they mess up
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> oh weird
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> idk i just looked at it
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and it looked ever so slightly low
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> based on how high u can jump up boxes etc
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> if u crouch in the jump
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> i noticed theres weird stuff wtih middair crouching
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> when i found if u jump while crouched
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> and then uncrouch mid jump
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> it actually makes ur jump silent
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> bc u dont fall far enough
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> to make sound
[«🎥»・media] a1ex7358 ==> so then i tested the opposite

[general] distortlight ==> exactly
[general] distortlight ==> if youre always going for head it can get you killed
[general] distortlight ==> but you also want a hs above 20 since not hitting heads can cause death
[general] jay_ssssun ==> Yeah I might for bodies more tbh
[general] jay_ssssun ==> The only time your hs should really be higher than like 30 is if your just having a life game because then you aren’t dying from it
[general] distortlight ==> yep

[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> if jett tries to follow you into the smoke
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> all sage has to do is sit in the smoke
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> and shoot jett as they run in
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> and if jett doesnt follow u in, then you just reswing out and get traded by sage
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> (or kill jett)
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> but more likely u die swingign the smoke and get traded
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> the only way that goes badly is the one exact play ur sage made
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> or heck, instead of u reswinging the smoke,
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> if sage did want to swing it
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> they just have to wait for u to be out ofdismiss
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> so then at least u can swing with them and trade THEM out
[«💭»・general] a1ex7358 ==> but swinging while youre still mid dismiss is just trolling
