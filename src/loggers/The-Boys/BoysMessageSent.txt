[«⛔»・no-mic] hetmastertje ==> absolute rain?
[«⛔»・no-mic] box_r ==> reign
[«⛔»・no-mic] hetmastertje ==> 47 Chapters?
[«⛔»・no-mic] hetmastertje ==> is this a prequel
[«⛔»・no-mic] hetmastertje ==> looking at logging library's
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> abu abu
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> say
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> I am box
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> yes u care box
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> guess
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> what it is
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> dont over think it
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> just guess
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> no
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> no
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> it is
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> lowkey love the website
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> its so good
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> definitely not done
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> i think ima add
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> File tracking nexts
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> including management of storage bucket
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> i was thinking making this the design
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> in the corner you would see ur storage left
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> backups below it same as the picture
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> File Service would be an Url aswell as a simple upload page aswell as guide
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> users would be renamed to Access

Access Tokens = [Number]
Bucket Public Status: true or false
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> and then youll be able to see how many requests is going to ur storage bucket
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> sure
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> <@869406935357743205>
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> USE ZOD
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> FOR MESSAGE VALIDATION
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> nvm
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> u dont need it
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> u should read what zod is tho
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> essentially
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> zod is a validation library
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> its very handy for systems that need to be specific
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> such as authentication
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> i can show u an example
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> ```export const SignUpSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  first_name: z.string(),
  last_name: z.string(),
  password: z.string().min(6), 
});```
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> this is example what u would use zod for
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> Email needs to be an email essentially we dont want numbers as the email that is basically what zod does
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> its essentially typescript validation in javascript
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> well if you ever were to make a public bot
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> that would be handle when logging messages
[«⛔»・no-mic] zypxn ==> yeah
